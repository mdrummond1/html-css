            <h1>Matthew's Portfolio</h1>

            <p>This page is a collection of information about me and holds a
            few of the projects that I have worked on over the course of my web
            development career.</p>

            <h2>about me</h2>
            
            <p>I am 27 years old. I started learning about web development
            almost 4 years ago. From there I started teaching myself to code
            and eventually decided to go back to school for computer science.
            As of now, I have about 4 months before I will graduate! This will
            my second bachelor's degree. My first was a B.A. in music. I enjoy
            all kinds of music and play several different instruments.</p>
