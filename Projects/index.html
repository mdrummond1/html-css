            <h1>Matthew's Portfolio</h1>
                <p>This page is a collection of information about me and holds a few of the projects that I have worked on
                over the course of my web development career.</p>
            <h2>about me<h2>

                <p>I am 27 years old. I started learning about web development almost 4 years ago.
                From there I started teaching myself to code and eventually decided to go back to school for
                computer science.
                As of now, I have about 4 months before I will graduate! This will my second bachelor's degree.
                My first was a B.A. in music. I enjoy all kinds of music and play several different instruments.
                </p>
