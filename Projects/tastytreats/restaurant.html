                Gabby's has been around for a year or two. My wife and I have eaten here several times,
                and the food is always great! The first time I ate there I got the Lomo soltado.
                This was essentially beef stir-fry, and it was wonderful! 
                The next visit I ordered a Chicharron sandwich. This was
                a fried pork tenderloin sandwich with fried sweet potatoes on it!
                Very interesing, and very good! On this same visit my wife ordered the House Tilapia.
                <br><br>
                <strong>TLDR; Gabby's is worth a visit if you enjoy South American cuisine.</strong>

            <h4>Brief Review</h4>
                <p>
                    While you wouldn't expect it from the location, Gabby's has a great atmosphere! 
                    The dining area is clean, homey, with great Peruvian artwork.
                    The service has been good every time we have eaten here.
                    The food is outstanding, as I have already mentioned. 
                    At roughly the same price of an applebees or chili's, Gabby's is a great deal for the quality.                
                    I give Gabby's 4 out of 5 stars!
