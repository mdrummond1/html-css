            <p>Sometimes all you need is a quick snack to give you energy and fill you up between meals.
                My favorite snack is a good peanut granola bar. I love peanut butter with a passion!
                This snack gets me my pb fix as well as fills me up until dinner time.

            <h3>Why this one?</h3>
            <p>This bar is packed with so much peanut butter flavor!
                These bars are also pretty healthy. You could eaten a bag of chips, but these are a much healthier option. 
                They are also quick. There is no preparation needed, you just open a package and eat up.
                You can take them anywhere to eat on the go. I keep 4 or 5 packages in my backpack to snack on throughout my week of classes.
