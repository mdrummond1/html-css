<p>In this project you continue to add to an embedded style sheet, starting with some ready-made <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. Your challenge is to  write embedded <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> code to solve the problems set out in items 1-5 below. </p>
    

<h2>CSS Tasks</h2>
<p>These exercises test your knowledge of working with colors and backgrounds. The numbered items below are the tasks you need to complete.Remember this is another Ugly Page challenge, so don't worry about making this page look good. In fact, break as many of the rules for good page design as you'd like.</p>
    
<p class="message">If you get stuck, refer back to <strong>chapter 13</strong> in your book.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Write a rule to set the background color of the page using either RGB or hexadecimal color values, set the page width to less than 100%, and set the page margins to auto.</li>
  
    <li>Update all color properties with color names to use RGB or hexadecimal values in all existing style rules.</li>
  
    <li>Write rules for the five link states so they are a different color than the rest of the text, and when you mouse over them, the underline either appears or disappears. The styles for the link and hover states should be visually different, and remember that order matters.  </li>
    
    <li>Write a rule to apply an appropriate background image  to the page <strong>header</strong> element. Remember that  header element height is determined by height of child elements inside the header. Increasing the font size and/or top and bottom padding in  h1 element rule will increase the height of the header, exposing more area of background image.</li>
    
  <li>Modify all the style rules to use shorthand wherever appropriate.</li>
</ol>
