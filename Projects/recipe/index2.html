        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        <p><small>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</small></p>
        <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique
            called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food
            (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is
            precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be
            cooked to. In his book, <q>Cooking for Geeks</q>, <cite>Jeff Potter describes
                it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></cite></p>
        <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill
                Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us
            before November 30.</p>

            555-336-1800</p>

        <p> Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it
            if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p>
